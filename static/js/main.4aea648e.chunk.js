Of all our visits that day, the most noted places are the Swayambhunath Stupa (a.k.a. the Monkey Temple, for its sheer number of resident monkeys), the Pashupatinath Temple, and the Durbar Square. The Durbar Square was a peculiar sight - it had been rocked to its core by the 2015 earthquake, and what we really saw were huge scaffolded structures with reconstruction going ahead at full pace. The next day would be tiring, so we cut the day short, and spent the evening at our hotel, enjoying a few drinks."}),Object(h.jsx)("p",{children:"We made our tired and hung-over selves wake up at 5 AM the next day, for, we were going to Pokhara!

Before Nepal, the only mountainous regions I had been to were either in my own country, or in Darjeeling, and Gangtok, India. I had never experienced anything of the sort in my life before. As soon as the bus left the outskirts of the city, the terrainous path stood in all its glory, carved through the majestic mountains. The sky was a perfect blue, it seemed that the day could only get better. We were accompanied by the river Trishuli over a great part of the journey, which had water so freakishly blue that it looked like something from a Nat Geo documentary. The lush greenery, the fresh Himalayan air, and the perfect weather - they made me feel we were moving through a highly detailed video game."}),Object(h.jsx)("p",{children:"Pokhara lived up to its expectations. It was nothing short of a piece of art. Our hotel was in a place called Lakeside, which, as you may guess, was beside a magnificent lake, named Phewa. Pokhara is really close to the Annapurna Range, and we could see the Annapurna peaks embedded in the afternoon sky. Lakeside was vibrant. There were more hotels and restaruants than we could count. The streets were extravagantly lit, and the air was filled with music coming from nearby bars and clubhouses."}),Object(h.jsx)("p",{children:"We hustled to put our clothes on and prepare ourselves for the day at 4 AM the next morning. Our first stop was Sarangkot, with the intention of watching the sun rise. The sun did not disappoint us - it was like every event in the trip had gone our way. The sun rising over the mighty Annapurna mountains was a sight to be reckoned with. The rising sun makes you feel inferior to the grandeur of Mother Nature, and I believe everyone should get to experience a sunrise at least once in their life."}),Object(h.jsx)("p",{children:"We then made our way to the Bindhyabasini Temple. The temple was a nice change of atmosphere from the crowded Sarangkot. It was serene. Our eyes ringed to the sweet tunes of the devotees offering their prayers to the creator. We moved on to the Rupakot resort, a magnanimous place for lunch. Anyone who visits Pokhara is highly recommended to visit Rupakot resort at least once. It serves awesome food at an even more awesome setting - in the clouds! The resort is really high up a hill, and on most days it is shrouded by a blanket of clouds till midday."}),Object(h.jsx)("p",{children:"Our next stop was the Shanti Stupa. It was the most challenging task of the day, for we had to climb up a hill for about twenty minutes to reach the Stupa.

The view from the top was also drop-dead gorgeous."}),Object(h.jsx)("p",{children:"Fast forwarding to the evening, we hired ourselves a boat and went on a ride through Lake Phewa. The calm waters led us to a small temple right at the middle of the lake, a local attraction. We soon took the boat trip back to Lakeside. After a bit of walking around, we decided to stop at a small cafe. We had a really talented local band performing for us that evening. I'm not the guy who takes a lot of pictures, but I'm glad I took one in the cafe, for it brings back memories of us enjoying the rock band's rendition of Ben E. King's 'Stand By Me' over a couple of beers and some fried fish."}),Object(h.jsx)("p",{children:"Our Pokhara trip ended the next day, with the three of us returning back to Kathmandu to catch a flight back to Dhaka the day after.

Although I was pretty hesitant and a tad bit scared before the trip, but now, a year and a half later, I'm glad I went, and I'm positive that I will be going back to Nepal for another bite.
