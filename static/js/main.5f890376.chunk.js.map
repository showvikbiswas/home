         Hi there. My name is Showvik. I'm currently an undergraduate student\r\n            at Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology, majoring in\r\n            Computer Science and Engineering. I enjoy the 'engineering' portion\r\n            of the subject. I love seeing complex designs built from scratch. It\r\n            has been a bit of a challenge for me to figure out where my passion\r\n            truly lies, but I have a thing for <b>computer security</b> and{\" \"}\r\n            <b>crpytography</b> for now.\r\n          </p>\r\n\r\n          <p>\r\n            When not staring at the screen, you can find me listening to music,\r\n            or playing video games, or at the local cafe with my friends. I also\r\n            love playing the drums and the Tabla, a traditional Indian\r\n            percussion instrument.\r\n          </p>\r\n\r\n          <p>\r\n            Traveling is something which I have always found alluring.

When I stepped out of the Boeing 737 on\r\n            the runways of Tribhuvan International Airport, the wind was the\r\n            first entity that reminded me that I am, indeed, far away from the\r\n            place I live. The wind was eerily chilly. It was probably the\r\n            country's way of greeting us. After all, it was the very first trip,\r\n            let alone an international one, where I did not have parental\r\n            supervision, and boy were we ready to enjoy!\r\n          </p>\r\n\r\n          <p>\r\n            The boring and tedious process of immigration (Nepali immigration\r\n            officers are real slowpokes) gave way to the three of us finding a\r\n            cab to our hotel. It felt like straight out of a page from{\" \"}\r\n            <b>Feluda</b> - it was so surreal! It was Kathmandu, and we were so\r\n            close to the Himalayas! A thing which I vividly remember on the\r\n            journey back to the hotel is the lunch we had along the way. I\r\n            remember it so well because I do not know half the stuff I had eaten\r\n            then till date. Apparently it was traditional Nepali food.\r\n          </p>\r\n\r\n          <p>\r\n            An interesting place I visited was the Garden of Dreams. A\r\n            beautifully lit palace, with a large courtyard, a courtside cafe.\r\n            You could choose to sit at the courtyard, alone with your thoughts\r\n            under the faint amber lamps, or enjoy a pint of beer at the cafe, or\r\n            even prepare a frame for your next profile picture on social media.\r\n            Yes, the beauty of the palace makes the most novice of photographers\r\n            shoot stunning portraits.\r\n          </p>\r\n\r\n          <p>\r\n            We had a packed itinerary the following day. After breakfast, we\r\n            hired a Suzuki sedan and set out. Of all our visits that day, the\r\n            most noted places are the Swayambhunath Stupa (a.k.a. the Monkey\r\n            Temple, for its sheer number of resident monkeys), the Pashupatinath\r\n            Temple, and the Durbar Square. The Durbar Square was a peculiar\r\n            sight - it had been rocked to its core by the 2015 earthquake, and\r\n            what we really saw were huge scaffolded structures with\r\n            reconstruction going ahead at full pace. The next day would be\r\n            tiring, so we cut the day short, and spent the evening at our hotel,\r\n            enjoying a few drinks.\r\n          </p>\r\n\r\n          <p>\r\n            We made our tired and hung-over selves wake up at 5 AM the next day,\r\n            for, we were going to Pokhara! Pokhara is a beautiful valley about\r\n            200 kilometers west of Kathmandu. We had high hopes about Pokhara,\r\n            but were in for a surprise.\r\n          </p>\r\n\r\n          <p>\r\n            They say, the journey is better than the destination, and I believe\r\n            the path from Kathmandu to Pokhara totally encapsulates the gist of\r\n            the saying. Before Nepal, the only mountainous regions I had been to\r\n            were either in my own country, or in Darjeeling, and Gangtok, India.\r\n            I had never experienced anything of the sort in my life before. As\r\n            soon as the bus left the outskirts of the city, the terrainous path\r\n            stood in all its glory, carved through the majestic mountains. The\r\n            sky was a perfect blue, it seemed that the day could only get\r\n            better. We were accompanied by the river Trishuli over a great part\r\n            of the journey, which had water so freakishly blue that it looked\r\n            like something from a Nat Geo documentary. The lush greenery, the\r\n            fresh Himalayan air, and the perfect weather - they made me feel we\r\n            were moving through a highly detailed video game.\r\n          </p>\r\n\r\n          <p>\r\n            Pokhara lived up to its expectations. It was nothing short of a\r\n            piece of art. Our hotel was in a place called Lakeside, which, as\r\n            you may guess, was beside a magnificent lake, named Phewa. Pokhara\r\n            is really close to the Annapurna Range, and we could see the\r\n            Annapurna peaks embedded in the afternoon sky. Lakeside was vibrant.\r\n            There were more hotels and restaruants than we could count. The\r\n            streets were extravagantly lit, and the air was filled with music\r\n            coming from nearby bars and clubhouses.\r\n          </p>\r\n\r\n          <p>\r\n            We hustled to put our clothes on and prepare ourselves for the day\r\n            at 4 AM the next morning. Our first stop was Sarangkot, with the\r\n            intention of watching the sun rise. The sun did not disappoint us -\r\n            it was like every event in the trip had gone our way. The sun rising\r\n            over the mighty Annapurna mountains was a sight to be reckoned with.\r\n            The rising sun makes you feel inferior to the grandeur of Mother\r\n            Nature, and I believe everyone should get to experience a sunrise at\r\n            least once in their life.\r\n          </p>\r\n\r\n          <p>\r\n            We then made our way to the Bindhyabasini Temple. The temple was a\r\n            nice change of atmosphere from the crowded Sarangkot. It was serene.\r\n            Our eyes ringed to the sweet tunes of the devotees offering their\r\n            prayers to the creator. We moved on to the Rupakot resort, a\r\n            magnanimous place for lunch. Anyone who visits Pokhara is highly\r\n            recommended to visit Rupakot resort at least once. It serves awesome\r\n            food at an even more awesome setting - in the clouds! The resort is\r\n            really high up a hill, and on most days it is shrouded by a blanket\r\n            of clouds till midday.\r\n          </p>\r\n\r\n          <p>\r\n            Our next stop was the Shanti Stupa. It was the most challenging task\r\n            of the day, for we had to climb up a hill for about twenty minutes\r\n            to reach the Stupa. By the end, we had been drained, but the Stupa\r\n            stood in front of us in its glory, and fatigue barely seemed an\r\n            issue anymore. The view from the top was also drop-dead gorgeous.\r\n          </p>\r\n\r\n          <p>\r\n            Fast forwarding to the evening, we hired ourselves a boat and went\r\n            on a ride through Lake Phewa. The calm waters led us to a small\r\n            temple right at the middle of the lake, a local attraction. We soon\r\n            took the boat trip back to Lakeside. After a bit of walking around,\r\n            we decided to stop at a small cafe. We had a really talented local\r\n            band performing for us that evening. I'm not the guy who takes a lot\r\n            of pictures, but I'm glad I took one in the cafe, for it brings back\r\n            memories of us enjoying the rock band's rendition of Ben E. King's\r\n            'Stand By Me' over a couple of beers and some fried fish.\r\n          </p>\r\n\r\n          <p>\r\n            Our Pokhara trip ended the next day, with the three of us returning\r\n            back to Kathmandu to catch a flight back to Dhaka the day after. We\r\n            had spent a total of five days in Nepal, and had spent about $300\r\n            per person on average (excluding plane fares) during our time.\r\n            Although I was pretty hesitant and a tad bit scared before the trip,\r\n            but now, a year and a half later, I'm glad I went, and I'm positive\r\n            that I will be going back to Nepal for another bite. The trip made\r\n            me realize that it is imperative to not be a frog in a well, and\r\n            that there are countless other places around the world that I must\r\n            go to before my time is up.\r\n          </p>\r\n        </div>\r\n      </div>\r\n      <Footer />\r\n    </div>\r\n  );\r\n};\r\n\r\nexport default Nepal;\r\n","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/Thali.c481bfb4.jpg\";","import \"./App.css\";\nimport Navbar from \"./components/Navbar.js\";\nimport { HashRouter as Router, Switch, Route } from \"react-router-dom\";\nimport Home from \"./components/pages/Home\";\nimport { useEffect, useRef } from \"react\";\nimport About from \"./components/pages/About\";\nimport Footer from \"./components/Footer\";\nimport Blog from \"./components/pages/Blog\";\nimport Nepal from \"./components/blogs/Nepal\";\n\nfunction App() {\n  return (\n    <div className=\"App\">\n      <Router basename=\"/\">\n        <Navbar />\n        <Switch>\n          <Route path=\"/\" exact component={Home}></Route>\n          <Route path=\"/about\" component={About} />\n          <Route path=\"/blog\" exact component={Blog} />\n          <Route path=\"/blog/nepal\" component={Nepal} />\n        </Switch>\n      </Router>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default App;\n","import React from \"react\";\nimport ReactDOM from \"react-dom\";\nimport App from \"./App\";\n\nReactDOM.render(\n  <React.StrictMode>\n    <App />\n  </React.StrictMode>,\n  document.getElementById(\"root\")\n);\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
